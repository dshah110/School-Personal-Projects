# Ping Server and Client

The first assignment of my networking class at UMD. A simple ping server and a client that can send pings to the server and receive responses.

## How to run

To run the server, use the following command:

```bash
make
./server
```

To run the client, use the following command:

```bash
make
./client
```

I think then you provide the address and port as arguments to the client. I don't remember, you can look at the code to see how to do that.
