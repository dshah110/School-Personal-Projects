# Distance Vector Routing Protocol

The second assignment of my networking class at UMD. A simple distance vector routing protocol. This one is a bit more complex than the ping server and client. It has a parser and scanner, event sets, link sets, routing tables, node-to-hostname, and a testing driver.

## How to run

To run the driver, use the following command:

```bash
make
./rt
```

Again forgot how to run it haha. Feel free to look through the code and figure it out yourself.

## Notes

### FILES
=====
ru.*	 :: parser and scanner 
es.*	 :: event set 
ls.*	 :: link set 
rt.*	 :: routing table 
n2h.*	 :: node-to-hostname 
dr.c	 :: a testing driver, including main(), calls walk_el
common.h :: common definitions
queue.h	 :: queue operation definition and macros
makefile :: type 'make' to generate executable "rt"
config	 :: a sample scenario file


### EXECUTABLE
==========
rt	 :: A sample driver including all modules, it does:
	    1. Use parser to generate event sets, node-t-hostname list.
	    2. Dumping all event sets.
	    3. Dispatching an event set every 2 secs.
	    4. Print out node-to-hostname set, link set and routing table
	       after one event set is dispatched
