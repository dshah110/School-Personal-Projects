# BitTorrent

This was the final project of my networking class and the most difficult one. It incorporated elements of chord (peer-to-peer distributed hash table) and torrenting (peer-to-peer file sharing).

To understand kind of how a bittorrent works, you can look at the torrent protocol specification at https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html

This project is a bit buggy and the code is wildly unoptimized and unstructured. One day I will revist this and refactor it - or start completely anew in a different language. But definitely the most fun, challenging, and rewarding project to date.

## How to run

To run the client, use the following command:

```bash
make all
./client
```
