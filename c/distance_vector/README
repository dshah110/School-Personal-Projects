# Distance Vector Routing Protocol

The second assignment of my networking class at UMD. A simple distance vector routing protocol. This one is a bit more complex than the ping server and client. It has a parser and scanner, event sets, link sets, routing tables, node-to-hostname, and a testing driver.

## How to run

To run the driver, use the following command:

```bash
make
./rt
```

Again forgot how to run it haha. Feel free to look through the code and figure it out yourself.
