# Overview

This repository contains a collection of school projects from my undergrad (pre-2022) that I recently discovered I had and a couple of recently done personal projects (up to you to figure out the details.....). A lot of fun projects to do and A LOT I would do differently if revisited. 

A lot of the projects here contain unstructured and messy code. Most of these were done for school when I was just starting to code.

My favorite school project was my bittorent project (but it also is the most unstructured and incomplete). Crazy that I made my own torrenter considering I thought these things were so cool growing up. Wish I did this in python or goland though, would have been a lot easier. I think memory management was the hardest? But can't remember as it was ~ 4 years ago.

Another one was chord, a peer to peer distributed hash table. Struggled sooooo much through that project, but learned just as much. It was good preparation (in hindsight) for the bittorrent project.

The Clear Cell Game project was the first one I was really proud of. It was the first project that I completed that was fun for me to play around with (as opposed to just following instructions).

Lastly, the most recent project I did was a GenAI project called context retriever. It was part of a hackathon that I did with some friends and colleagues. The code we did in around a days time (the day included a lot of research and testing) and was a lot of fun. Learned so much about rag tools and how they work. Definitely want to revisit this for the future.
