# school_projects
A collection of school projects from my undergrad (pre-2022) that I recently discovered I had. Fun projects to do, a lot I would do differently if revisited. 
Currently contains a collection of unstructured messy code but contains some interesting projects. 

Favorite one was my bittorent project (but it also is the most unstructured and incomplete). Crazy that I made my own torrenter considering I thought these things were so cool growing up. Wish I did this in python or goland though, would have been a lot easier. I think memory management was the hardest? But can't remember as it was ~ 4 years ago.

Another was chord, a peer to peer distributed hash table. Struggled sooooo much through that project, but learned just as much. It was good preparation (in hindsight) for the bittorrent project.

Hopefully I can find some of my Java projects but they may be buried.
